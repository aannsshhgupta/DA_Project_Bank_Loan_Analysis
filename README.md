🚀 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard | Power BI, Excel & SQL

I recently completed a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard project using Power BI, Excel, and SQL, aimed at turning complex loan data into actionable insights for improved financial decision-making and risk management.

📊 Power BI Dashboard:
*This interactive dashboard offers a clear overview of 38.6K total loan applications, with deep insights into funding ($435.8M), repayments ($473.1M), and key performance metrics like Average Interest Rate (12.05%) and Average DTI (13.33%).

*Advanced DAX measures power Month-to-Date (MTD), Previous Month, and Month-over-Month (MoM) analytics, allowing dynamic filtering by loan purpose, grade, and borrower profile.

*It helps identify trends in good vs. bad loans and reveals strategic insights like regional performance and risk patterns.

📈 Excel Dashboard:
*I also created a feature-rich Excel version of the dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and custom visuals.

*This model mirrors the Power BI interface while maintaining the flexibility of Excel. It highlights loan status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current), borrower demographics, loan purpose, and term-wise breakdowns.


🛠 SQL Query Document:
To support data analysis, I developed a SQL query document containing structured logic for key KPIs, loan categorization, financial metric calculation, and trend comparisons. It ensures accurate data extraction and feeds both dashboards with consistent, validated data.

📁 Dataset Used: Bank Loan Data (Raw to Report pipeline)

🧠 Tools & Skills Applied: Power BI, Excel, SQL, DAX, Data Cleaning, Data Modeling, Dashboard Design

This project strengthened my ability to create intuitive solutions that translate complex financial data into actionable insights. The dashboard is tailored for bank analysts and risk managers, providing a strategic view of portfolio health and borrower behavior to drive better lending decisions.
